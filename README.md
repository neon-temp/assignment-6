     A gradebook App.

   . I created an html , css, and javascript webpage. 
   
   . The html included the gradebook(table), and some h1, h3, p, strong tags. It also contained a direction to follow in order to 
   view one's result in the console depending on your device(mainly laptops).
   
   . In the css, i designed the header, table, and text container in order to make it look presentable.
   
   . In the javascript, i made a list of interns, their task scores, and calculated an average , which only shows in the terminal and console.
   
   . In order to view this average score , adhere to the webpage.
